                        <div class="ayo">Once upon a time, Ace was excited and thrilled to learn of his lineage. Son of the Pirate King? What could be cooler? Not understanding the trepidation and disliking the fact that it had to remain secret, the little boy ventured into town to pose the question "what if". Surely people would think it was as cool as he did. "What if Roger had a child?" That one question turned his life upside down. Hatred and malicious intent surrounded him, many brutal ways people wanted him to die filling his young ears.<br><br>
The son of Roger wasn't supposed to exist. He shouldn't have been born.<br><br>
Slowly Ace grew to hate Roger. The father once loved for his achievements and life was scorned, sending the child into a volatile rage whenever the name so much as touched his ears. It was <i>his</i> fault everyone hated Ace. <i>His</i> fault the world would be better without one no-more hopeful little boy.<br><br>
Now older, Ace thinks absolutely nothing of Roger. He's unimportant and only a cause for people to hate him. He aviods the subject and tries to brush it off unless something is directed to him, but he gets nervous inside if someone in the crew mentions it.</div>

Her not being around hasn't changed his feelings for her at all. Love has been unconditionally given, and so she recieved it in return. Often he wishes she were around to be with him, and he sometimes goes out to the shore late at night to try and feel closer to her.<br><br>
Because on that shore far away on Baterilla she was standing. In another time, another place, they were looking to the same thing.</div>

                        <div class="ayo">All his life, Ace was 'taken care of' by Dadan and her family of mountain bandits. This mainly has consisted of him being given a roof to sleep under and a small room to live in, but that's about the extent of it. Everything Ace wants and needs he gets for himself, and there's little to no communication between him and the bandits. They co-existed but that's it, Ace's home lies elsewhere.<br><br>
It wasn't uncommon for him to return home late and find, since it meant he didn't return with dinner, that Dadan has dipped into her stores and was drunkenly ranting about him. Ace was fully aware that Dadan doesn't care about him or if he ever returns, and that she considered him a devil.<br><br>
It wasn't until Luffy came into his life that this changed, and she began to act more like the mother she was to them as Ace thawed his chilly exterior. Her putting her life on the line for him when the Grey Terminal burned made him trust and love her completely, even if he didn't show it all that much sometimes.</div>

Violent and lonely things dominate these night time horror shows, and it sends him into an fit to get comfortable that lasts the entire night. When he wakes, he's often sprawled not where he was in a tangle of blankets.<br><br>
Sleeping with someone nearby calms this and quells the bad dreams, leaving him to sleep peacefully though still with a great deal of moving - unless that nearby person is in contact with him.</div>

                        <div class="ayo">Killing people is something Ace doesn't tend to think about. He fights, he wins, and people are left bloody and/or unconcious. If they die he never knows and never cares. When it comes to actual intent, he prefers to beat them and let nature take care of the rest. He never sees them again? Great, work done. Doesn't matter if they're laying broken at the bottom of a ravine or drowned by the ocean.<br><br>
Killing people up close and personal is a whole other thing. He's never fought someone with the intent to directly kill, and when put to a situation that counts as blatant straight-up murder, he becomes unnerved.<br><br>

When he went to kill Whitebeard it was his goal, and he needed to kill him to feel any sort of okay with himself. It was to confirm that he was his own person and not just Rogerâs son.<br><br>

It was a way to set him apart from what he desperately needed to, which was why the longer he didnât kill Whitebeard the more lost he seemed to become, until finally he was left a purposeless husk on the ship around the time he had that talk with Marco.<br><br>

It wasnât like he was trying to kill the crew while he was there. And honestly, if he had no qualms about killing he would have just tried to off them all. They followed a man he hated, after all. Might as well get rid of them. But he didnât. He didnât even try.</div>

Every night when he stopped to rest, thoughts of his brothers and home would fill his head, leaving him aching for the family heâd come to love. Each night the feeling got worse, starting on the first night with a small twinge of longing and finally getting to the point where he has trouble sleeping because of it. But still he couldnât turn back, not without taking down someone who had spat in his fatherâs face so openly.</div>

                        <div class="ayo">The reason Ace flew off the handle so badly when Teach killed Thatch was due to several reasons. First: Teach had been under his command in his division, and thus the betrayal was far more personal than if heâd been in someone elseâs. Second: Over the few years Ace had spent on the Moby Dick, Thatch was one of the people heâd grown closest to, right alongside Marco and Whitebeard. The death of someone so special to him flared his temper instantly.<br><br>
Third: Losing Thatch reminded him painfully of when heâd lost Sabo. That particular death heâd been able to do nothing about and was barred from exacting his vengeance on his brotherâs murderer. He wouldnât allow such a thing to happen a second time. This time, the murderer would pay. Even if it cost him his own life. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">While aboard the Moby Dick, Ace likes to remain on the deck whenever possible. He likes the fresh air and the smell of the sea, and he occasionally is found looking out at the waves. This is something he tended to avoid whenever Marco or Thatch were around (when Thatch was still around. Since the incident, he hasnât been back to the ship much, and only for short bursts when he does return), as they took pretty much any opportunity to tease him.<br><br>

He likes to stay in motion as well, so heâs often moving about the deck and pestering everyone with his movement. When Marcoâs around, he has a habit of scaling the masts in obviously dangerous fashions in an attempt to make Marco shift into his phoenix form, as he very much likes to see it.<br><br>

Taking watch in the middle of the night is also something he enjoys doing, but he likes to try and force one of his brothers or sisters (mainly Marco and Thatch) to stay up with him. Mainly because he tends to fall asleep at some point either from his Narcolepsy or from simply the hour and how much heâd been moving that day. But also because he simply enjoys their company.</div>

                        <div class="ayo">Fighting with Marco was kind of a daily -or nightly- thing back before Ace left the ship. It didnât take much for him to goad Marco into a fight or vice versa, a part of the day that Ace enjoyed a great deal even though he never really won. As they fought, Thatch would sit off to the side, just waiting for one -or both- to go flying over the rail and into the sea for him to dive in after.<br><br>
Since Thatchâs death, however, Ace has found fighting with Marco at night is not as fun as it used to be, as heâs almost died several times because of it. Now he avoids it unless there are other people around that can help when things go wrong. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">Ace finds it hard to believe that so many people could accept him and call him their brother, seeing as everyone in the crew (a total at more than a thousand people) does. Still, thereâs a worry in the back of his mind on what would happen should they all find out about his blood. He fears that he will be completely rejected should they all somehow learn of it.  The only ones in his new family who know are Whitebeard and Marco, as he felt it was important to tell the two in charge of running the ship.</div>

The depths of his heart is something he guards with wary walls, not daring to let anyone too close for fear of what theyâll think of the true him. Those that can get past these walls can be considered nothing short of the most important people to him, for these are the people he comes to love the most whether itâs romantically or otherwise. </div>

However, his opinion revised upon making his promise to Luffy and Sabo, and now his family is very important to him. Roger has been disregarded from this category completely in favor of his âtrue fatherâ, or Whitebeard, who Ace accepts without hesitation because the same was done for him by the old man.</div>

                        <div class="ayo">Few people were close to Ace and he prefered to keep it that way, choosing to instead stick to those he knew he could trust. Others would scorn him if they knew, he learned that well enough with all the bars and hypothetical questions. No, they didn't really want him around. They never would, not with the desire for him dead hidden not-so deep in their hearts.<br><br>

He couldn't get close to people because he's a monster.<br><br>

And it made him <i>hate.</i></div>

                        <div class="ayo">Ace is fully aware that he will never make it to an old age. Not only is he a pirate, but heâs a commander in the crew of a Yonko and the son of one of the most hated men to roam the world. Luck is not something he was born with and wasnât something he expects, and he knows that it will run out more sooner than later. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">Ace never received a formal education or much of any education at all, really. All he learned was from what he experienced, as he simply refused to learn anything from the bandits he grew up with. Sabo was the one who taught him how to read and write, though the process took quite a while considering Ace would continually get frustrated and storm off without finishing a lesson. When the time came for Luffy to learn, Ace taught him in place of their missing brother. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">The years following Saboâs death were spent with Ace sitting on that cliff face where him and his brothers had made their promise, looking out at the ocean in hopes that he would see his lost brother returning to him. Heâd always known it was a vain hope. Sabo was dead and Ace would never seen his crooked smile again.<br><br>

But still he hope, wishing that it wasnât really the end and that something unexpected had whisked his brother away from that place of death. For the longest time, Sabo had been the one who made Ace truly feel like he belonged, even if that feeling had been shaky at best. So how could someone so special, so important, die just like that?<br>

Up until the day he left Dawn Island, Ace spent at least a few minutes everyday looking out at the sea. Most of the time this was while Luffy was sleeping, so the younger boy wouldnât see how truly sad he was. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">Death means something different to Ace depending on who itâs about. If it regards other people, particularly those he cares for, he will do whatever he needs to keep death away from his loved ones.<br><br>

Death to Ace, however, is certain.<br><br>

<i>""I donât want to live forever. If I just live through today, thatâll be enough."</i><br><br>

He realizes that death is inevitable, especially for someone like him. It comes to everyone and to people who live a dangerous lifestyle especially. Pirates especially have a high mortality rate and he wonât bother denying it.<br><br>

People would hate him if they knew and because of his blood, they would kill him. This just adds to his belief that he will die young, though he doesnât bother to dwell on it. If it happens it happens.<br><br>

So he makes the most of everyday, living life with no regrets.<br><br>

In regards to how he believes he will die:<br><br>

Ace knows heâs fiercely loyal and incredibly protective for those close to him. If anything takes him down, it will be in one of those moments when he canât turn his back and he canât run, because thereâs someone or something precious behind him.<br><br>

Of course, he knows it could happen any time or with any circumstance. Ace just believes that the highest probability lies with raging emotions. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">When it comes to sex, Ace tends to be an incredibly dominant person. He takes control confidently and thoroughly enjoys the pleasure of the person under him, enjoying knowing that heâs the one doing it to them. It makes him feel like, even if itâs just for a short while, someone is glad that heâs in the world. </div>

                        <div class="ayo">Both Ace and Marco are drawn to each otherâs fire in a rather sensual way. The phoenix desires to be close to that which it requires: intense natural fire. The flame desires to be close to that which loves and stokes its need to burn: the phoenix.<br><br>

Itâs not uncommon for sparring between them to wind up with them in bed, as both consider their entwining flames to be a sort of foreplay that only they can feel. And itâs also not that uncommon for fire to be used during the actual sex, since neither of them can be harmed by the heat and it only serves to draw them closer together.</div>

It takes someone he cares for deeply for such things to even cross his mind, and if he manages to catch that elusive person who holds his love then absolutely nothing is held back.</div>
